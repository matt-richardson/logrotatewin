## logrotatewin

[![Build Status (Master Branch)](https://travis-ci.org/matt-richardson/logrotatewin.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/matt-richardson/logrotatewin)

A Windows implementation of the logrotate utility found in Linux platforms. The goal is to use the same command line parameters and files as the Linux version.


Forked from the great work by [Kenneth Salter](http://sourceforge.net/projects/logrotatewin/).

## why the fork?
There was a bug around weekly rotation not working - needed to add some unit tests, which required some refactoring. Hopefully, these changes will be merged back into the main codebase.
